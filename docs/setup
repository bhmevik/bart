This document describes how to setup the SGAS BaRT.

The tool consists of two programs/scripts:

bart-logger     : Creates usage records by parsing LRMS logs.
bart-registrant : Registers usage records to SGAS.

The logger will scan LRMS records and generate usage records (typically in
/var/spool/bart/usagerecords/), and the registrant registers them. Both
programs should be invoked regularly by CRON or similar. None of the programs
are daemons.


== Requirements ==

* Python 2.4 or later
* Twisted Core and Web (http://twistedmatrix.com/)
* PyOpenSSL (https://launchpad.net/pyopenssl)

Typical package names: python-twisted python-twisted-web python-openssl


== Installation ==

$ sudo python setup.py install

Edit the configuration files in /etc/bart/ (or relative to your root if you set
a root).

Add bart-logger to cron.hourly / crontab (daily is also possible)

The bart-logger tool can also be invoked manually to test it (note that it will
still write to the logfile).

Check /var/log/bart-logger.log after invokation. Generated urs will be in
/var/spool/bart/usagerecords/ (or where configured)

Having verified that the logger work, add bart-registrant to cron.hourly /
crontab.

The programs does not need to run as root as such, however:
bart-logger     : requires read access to the LRMS records
bart-registrant : requires read access to host key and certificate

Both programs of course require read/write access to the spool directory, which
will probably have to created manually if running as non-root (as only root can
create directories in /var/spool/
