Some LRMSes, notably SLURM will re-run jobs using the jobid, creating multiple
entries for a single job id. This creates a problem with the identification of
jobs, as multiple records end up describing the same job due the job id being
used for uniquely identifying a job.

To remedy this, the SLURM backend can append the start time of a job to the
record id, which is used to identify the job. To enables this, set the value
"idtimestamp" to "true" in the [common] section, i.e.:

[common]
idtimestamp=true

If the site runs an ARC installation, this value must also be set in [logger]
section in ARC.
